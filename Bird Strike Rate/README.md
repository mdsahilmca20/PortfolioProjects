# Data Visualization of Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011

### Problem Statement:
Transport and communication is one of the crucial domain in field of analytics. Environmental impacts and safety are, nowadays, two major concerns of the scientific community with respect to transport scenarios and to the ever-growing urban areas. These issues gain more importance due to the increasing amount of vehicles and people. Seeking for new solutions is reaching a point where available technologies and artificial intelligence, especially MAS, are being recognized as ways to cope and tackle these kinds of problems in a distributed and more appropriate way.

A bird strike is strictly defined as a collision between a bird and an aircraft which is in  flight or on a take-off or landing roll. The term is often expanded to cover other wildlife 
strikes - with bats or ground animals. Bird Strike is common and can be a significant threat to aircraft safety. For smaller aircraft, significant damage may be caused to the 
aircraft structure and all aircraft, especially jet-engine ones are vulnerable to the loss of thrust which can follow the ingestion of birds into engine air intakes. This has resulted in
several fatal accidents. Bird strikes may occur during any phase of flight, but are most likely during the take-off, initial climb, approach and landing phases due to the greater numbers of birds in flight at lower levels. To have a closer look the following document visually depicts the data collected on Bird Strikes by FAA between 2000-2011.


### Objective:
Build a dashboard to analyze Bird Strikes between 2000 – 2011 in the US for aircraft safety and wildlife safety. 


### Benefits:
- Depicting the Number of Bird Strikes.
- Cost and damage analysis due to Bird Strikes.
- To understand when most bird strikes occur.
- Effect of Bird Strikes.
- Analyzing wildlife species that are most often struck. 
- Try to find out patterns between aircraft type and bird strike.
